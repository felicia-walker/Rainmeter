Vedus' Kana Cards
==================================================
This is divided in to three basic packs for character sets:
	Hiragana
	Katakana
	Hiragana & Katakana
	
These are further subdivided in
	Singles (only individuals characters)
	Doubles (characters modified by a second character)
	All
==================================================	
   This skin assumes a few things. The first is that you have 
Japanese language support installed. It does not use images
for the kana characters it displays. Second, it also assumes 
you have MS PGothic font installed. If you have neither I 
suggest a Google search for installing Japanese language
support on your system. Once that's done if you still don't 
have the font I mention find one that you like and modify
the ini files yourself.

   The ini files themselves are very straight forward and 
borrowed quite a bit from the Chuck Norris Fact skin.

   These were designed to fill a function and as such are 
very basic. If you have any suggestions it's probably just
better to do it yourself. I have what I need and will probably
never update this skin. If you want to update it feel free.
Modify it, change it, call it your own. 

  The roots are there to do any language flash cards that 
require non-latin characters. It could just as easily be 
used for vocabulary or reading comprehension.
